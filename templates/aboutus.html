            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>
                ReMedi isn’t just another corporate app—it’s a passion project brought to life by <strong>four Computer Science enthusiasts</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As undergraduates, we noticed a disconnect between complex medical prescriptions and the chaotic schedule of daily life. We asked ourselves: <em>"Can we use Python and Cloud tech to fix this?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                We combined our skills in <strong>Full-stack Web Development</strong> and <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> to build a solution that is secure, fast, and actually helpful. This project represents our journey from writing lines of code in a dorm room to deploying a real-world health assistant.
